    "From the objective, we see the problem can be viewed as least-squares with an additional sum-of-squares penalty term of the model parameters $\\beta$. In fact, ridge regression is an example of shrinkage method that aims to reduce the variance of the estimates by purposefully introducing bias. The value of $\\lambda$ controls the level of shrinkage—the larger the value of $\\lambda$, the more model parameters are shrunk toward zero as well as each other. In practice, $\\lambda$ is chosen so that the resulting model achieves better generalizability (_e.g._ reduced test error). "

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we use the `yolanda` dataset from the [AutoML Challenge](https://automl.chalearn.org/data) {cite}`rr-guyon2019analysis`. The original dataset consists of 400,000 training samples and 30,000 test samples where each sample has 100 numerical features. Since the labels on the test data were never published, we instead randomly split the training data into training and test subsets with a 80/20 ratio. We opt to obtain the dataset from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/d/42705) over the [original source](https://competitions.codalab.org/my/datasets/download/41847153-1338-4514-a693-547f1288e8c4) as the former is readily supported by the [scikit-learn API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/loading_other_datasets.html#downloading-datasets-from-the-openml-org-repository). \n",
    "\n",
    "As a pre-processing step, we first standardize input features as well as target labels, and then apply random Fourier features transformation {cite}`rr-rahimi2007random`. Standardization of the input is often necesary as the solution to the ridge objective is not equivariant under scaling of the inputs, whereas standardization of the label is for convenience as the intercept in this case becomes trivial and thus can be safely ignored. To see this, note that since the inputs are standardized (hence centered), the intercept can be estimated by $(1/n) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$ which evaluates to zero if the label is also standardized (or simply centered). Lastly, the random features transformation efficiently approximates a kernel function and leads to small effective dimension of the Hessian that preconditioned methods like PROMISE {cite}`rr-frangella2024promise` are able to effectively leverage. \n"

    "We now specify hyperparameters and fit the model using SketchySAGA (with the Nyström subsampled Newton preconditioner). Rank and regularization for the preconditioner are set to their default values ($10$ and $10^{-3}$ respectively). Since the ridge objective has a constant Hessian, we set the preconditioner update frequency to $0$ so that it is only computed once and held constant throughout the run. The rest follows the recommended values discussed in the PROMISE paper {cite}`rr-frangella2024promise`. In this example, we arbitrarily set the regularization strength $\\lambda = 0.01/n$ to demonstrate the performance of SketchySAGA as this small value is not likely to meaningfully improve the conditioning of the problem. As explained in the introduction, this value in practice is typically chosen via a more principled approach like cross-validation. "

    "In this example, hyperparameters of the preconditioner were set to their default values. We might get a faster convergence from a larger rank value, though the effect depends on the spetrum of the dataset. If you expect the dataset to exhibit spectral decay, then tuning rank value could lead to improvement in convergence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another pratical suggestion we would like to make is enbaling JIT-compilation could make a difference. Although the compilation process takes additional time before the actual code execution, the time saved up from each subsequent calls to the JIT-compiled functions can make this trade-off worthwhile, especially if the solver is expected to run an extended number of iterations. For a problem that requires frequent update to the preconditioner, the performance parity is going to be even more pronounced. "
